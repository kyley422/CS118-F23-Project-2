< the matter of whales; he followed these fish for the fun of it; and a
< three years‚Äô voyage round Cape Horn was only a jolly joke that lasted
< that length of time. As a carpenter‚Äôs nails are divided into wrought
< nails and cut nails; so mankind may be similarly divided. Little Flask
< was one of the wrought ones; made to clinch tight and last long. They
< called him King-Post on board of the Pequod; because, in form, he could
< be well likened to the short, square timber known by that name in
< Arctic whalers; and which by the means of many radiating side timbers
< inserted into it, serves to brace the ship against the icy concussions
< of those battering seas.
< 
< Now these three mates‚ÄîStarbuck, Stubb, and Flask, were momentous men.
< They it was who by universal prescription commanded three of the
< Pequod‚Äôs boats as headsmen. In that grand order of battle in which
< Captain Ahab would probably marshal his forces to descend on the
< whales, these three headsmen were as captains of companies. Or, being
< armed with their long keen whaling spears, they were as a picked trio
< of lancers; even as the harpooneers were flingers of javelins.
< 
< And since in this famous fishery, each mate or headsman, like a Gothic
< Knight of old, is always accompanied by his boat-steerer or harpooneer,
< who in certain conjunctures provides him with a fresh lance, when the
< former one has been badly twisted, or elbowed in the assault; and
< moreover, as there generally subsists between the two, a close intimacy
< and friendliness; it is therefore but meet, that in this place we set
< down who the Pequod‚Äôs harpooneers were, and to what headsman each of
< them belonged.
< 
< First of all was Queequeg, whom Starbuck, the chief mate, had selected
< for his squire. But Queequeg is already known.
< 
< Next was Tashtego, an unmixed Indian from Gay Head, the most westerly
< promontory of Martha‚Äôs Vineyard, where there still exists the last
< remnant of a village of red men, which has long supplied the

< should like to see a boat‚Äôs crew backing water up to a whale face
< foremost. Ha, ha! the whale would give them squint for squint, mind
< that!‚Äù
< 
< Here then, from three impartial witnesses, I had a deliberate statement
< of the entire case. Considering, therefore, that squalls and capsizings
< in the water and consequent bivouacks on the deep, were matters of
< common occurrence in this kind of life; considering that at the
< superlatively critical instant of going on to the whale I must resign
< my life into the hands of him who steered the boat‚Äîoftentimes a fellow
< who at that very moment is in his impetuousness upon the point of
< scuttling the craft with his own frantic stampings; considering that
< the particular disaster to our own particular boat was chiefly to be
< imputed to Starbuck‚Äôs driving on to his whale almost in the teeth of a
< squall, and considering that Starbuck, notwithstanding, was famous for
< his great heedfulness in the fishery; considering that I belonged to
< this uncommonly prudent Starbuck‚Äôs boat; and finally considering in
< what a devil‚Äôs chase I was implicated, touching the White Whale: taking
< all things together, I say, I thought I might as well go below and make
< a rough draft of my will. ‚ÄúQueequeg,‚Äù said I, ‚Äúcome along, you shall be
< my lawyer, executor, and legatee.‚Äù
< 
< It may seem strange that of all men sailors should be tinkering at
< their last wills and testaments, but there are no people in the world
< more fond of that diversion. This was the fourth time in my nautical
< life that I had done the same thing. After the ceremony was concluded
< upon the present occasion, I felt all the easier; a stone was rolled
< away from my heart. Besides, all the days I should now live would be as
< good as the days that Lazarus lived after his resurrection; a
< supplementary clean gain of so many months or weeks as the case might
< be. I survived myself; my death and burial were locked up in my chest.
< I looked round me tranquilly and contentedly, like a quiet ghost with a

< in the trough of the sea, and ever and anon tranquilly spouting his
< vapory jet, the whale looked like a portly burgher smoking his pipe of
< a warm afternoon. But that pipe, poor whale, was thy last. As if struck
< by some enchanter‚Äôs wand, the sleepy ship and every sleeper in it all
< at once started into wakefulness; and more than a score of voices from
< all parts of the vessel, simultaneously with the three notes from
< aloft, shouted forth the accustomed cry, as the great fish slowly and
< regularly spouted the sparkling brine into the air.
< 
< ‚ÄúClear away the boats! Luff!‚Äù cried Ahab. And obeying his own order, he
< dashed the helm down before the helmsman could handle the spokes.
< 
< The sudden exclamations of the crew must have alarmed the whale; and
< ere the boats were down, majestically turning, he swam away to the
< leeward, but with such a steady tranquillity, and making so few ripples
< as he swam, that thinking after all he might not as yet be alarmed,
< Ahab gave orders that not an oar should be used, and no man must speak
< but in whispers. So seated like Ontario Indians on the gunwales of the
< boats, we swiftly but silently paddled along; the calm not admitting of
< the noiseless sails being set. Presently, as we thus glided in chase,
< the monster perpendicularly flitted his tail forty feet into the air,
< and then sank out of sight like a tower swallowed up.
< 
< ‚ÄúThere go flukes!‚Äù was the cry, an announcement immediately followed by
< Stubb‚Äôs producing his match and igniting his pipe, for now a respite
< was granted. After the full interval of his sounding had elapsed, the
< whale rose again, and being now in advance of the smoker‚Äôs boat, and
< much nearer to it than to any of the others, Stubb counted upon the
< honor of the capture. It was obvious, now, that the whale had at length
< become aware of his pursuers. All silence of cautiousness was therefore
< no longer of use. Paddles were dropped, and oars came loudly into play.
< And still puffing at his pipe, Stubb cheered on his crew to the
< assault.

< of them clutched the gunwale again, and rising to its level on a
< combing wave, hurled themselves bodily inboard again; the third man
< helplessly dropping astern, but still afloat and swimming.
< 
< Almost simultaneously, with a mighty volition of ungraduated,
< instantaneous swiftness, the White Whale darted through the weltering
< sea. But when Ahab cried out to the steersman to take new turns with
< the line, and hold it so; and commanded the crew to turn round on their
< seats, and tow the boat up to the mark; the moment the treacherous line
< felt that double strain and tug, it snapped in the empty air!
< 
< ‚ÄúWhat breaks in me? Some sinew cracks!‚Äî‚Äôtis whole again; oars! oars!
< Burst in upon him!‚Äù
< 
< Hearing the tremendous rush of the sea-crashing boat, the whale wheeled
< round to present his blank forehead at bay; but in that evolution,
< catching sight of the nearing black hull of the ship; seemingly seeing
< in it the source of all his persecutions; bethinking it‚Äîit may be‚Äîa
< larger and nobler foe; of a sudden, he bore down upon its advancing
< prow, smiting his jaws amid fiery showers of foam.
< 
< Ahab staggered; his hand smote his forehead. ‚ÄúI grow blind; hands!
< stretch out before me that I may yet grope my way. Is‚Äôt night?‚Äù
< 
< ‚ÄúThe whale! The ship!‚Äù cried the cringing oarsmen.
< 
< ‚ÄúOars! oars! Slope downwards to thy depths, O sea, that ere it be for
< ever too late, Ahab may slide this last, last time upon his mark! I
< see: the ship! the ship! Dash on, my men! Will ye not save my ship?‚Äù
< 
< But as the oarsmen violently forced their boat through the
< sledge-hammering seas, the before whale-smitten bow-ends of two planks
< burst through, and in an instant almost, the temporarily disabled boat
< lay nearly level with the waves; its half-wading, splashing crew,
< trying hard to stop the gap and bale out the pouring water.
< 
< Meantime, for that one beholding instant, Tashtego‚Äôs mast-head hammer
< remained suspended in his hand; and the red flag, half-wrapping him as
< with a plaid, then streamed itself straight out from him, as his own
< forward-flowing heart; while Starbuck and Stubb, standing upon the
< bowsprit beneath, caught sight of the down-coming monster just as soon
< as he.
< 
< ‚ÄúThe whale, the whale! Up helm, up helm! Oh, all ye sweet powers of
< air, now hug me close! Let not Starbuck die, if die he must, in a
< woman‚Äôs fainting fit. Up helm, I say‚Äîye fools, the jaw! the jaw! Is
< this the end of all my bursting prayers? all my life-long fidelities?
< Oh, Ahab, Ahab, lo, thy work. Steady! helmsman, steady. Nay, nay! Up
< helm again! He turns to meet us! Oh, his unappeasable brow drives on
< towards one, whose duty tells him he cannot depart. My God, stand by me
< now!‚Äù
< 
< ‚ÄúStand not by me, but stand under me, whoever you are that will now
< help Stubb; for Stubb, too, sticks here. I grin at thee, thou grinning
< whale! Who ever helped Stubb, or kept Stubb awake, but Stubb‚Äôs own
< unwinking eye? And now poor Stubb goes to bed upon a mattrass that is
< all too soft; would it were stuffed with brushwood! I grin at thee,
< thou grinning whale! Look ye, sun, moon, and stars! I call ye assassins
< of as good a fellow as ever spouted up his ghost. For all that, I would
< yet ring glasses with ye, would ye but hand the cup! Oh, oh! oh, oh!
< thou grinning whale, but there‚Äôll be plenty of gulping soon! Why fly ye
< not, O Ahab! For me, off shoes and jacket to it; let Stubb die in his
< drawers! A most mouldy and over salted death, though;‚Äîcherries!
< cherries! cherries! Oh, Flask, for one red cherry ere we die!‚Äù
< 
< ‚ÄúCherries? I only wish that we were where they grow. Oh, Stubb, I hope
< my poor mother‚Äôs drawn my part-pay ere this; if not, few coppers will
< now come to her, for the voyage is up.‚Äù
< 
< From the ship‚Äôs bows, nearly all the seamen now hung inactive; hammers,
< bits of plank, lances, and harpoons, mechanically retained in their
< hands, just as they had darted from their various employments; all
< their enchanted eyes intent upon the whale, which from side to side
< strangely vibrating his predestinating head, sent a broad band of
< overspreading semicircular foam before him as he rushed. Retribution,
< swift vengeance, eternal malice were in his whole aspect, and spite of
< all that mortal man could do, the solid white buttress of his forehead
< smote the ship‚Äôs starboard bow, till men and timbers reeled. Some fell
< flat upon their faces. Like dislodged trucks, the heads of the
< harpooneers aloft shook on their bull-like necks. Through the breach,
< they heard the waters pour, as mountain torrents down a flume.
< 
< ‚ÄúThe ship! The hearse!‚Äîthe second hearse!‚Äù cried Ahab from the boat;
< ‚Äúits wood could only be American!‚Äù
< 
< Diving beneath the settling ship, the whale ran quivering along its
< keel; but turning under water, swiftly shot to the surface again, far
< off the other bow, but within a few yards of Ahab‚Äôs boat, where, for a
< time, he lay quiescent.
< 
< ‚ÄúI turn my body from the sun. What ho, Tashtego! let me hear thy
< hammer. Oh! ye three unsurrendered spires of mine; thou uncracked keel;
< and only god-bullied hull; thou firm deck, and haughty helm, and
< Pole-pointed prow,‚Äîdeath-glorious ship! must ye then perish, and
< without me? Am I cut off from the last fond pride of meanest
< shipwrecked captains? Oh, lonely death on lonely life! Oh, now I feel
< my topmost greatness lies in my topmost grief. Ho, ho! from all your
< furthest bounds, pour ye now in, ye bold billows of my whole foregone
< life, and top this one piled comber of my death! Towards thee I roll,
< thou all-destroying but unconquering whale; to the last I grapple with
< thee; from hell‚Äôs heart I stab at thee; for hate‚Äôs sake I spit my last
< breath at thee. Sink all coffins and all hearses to one common pool!
< and since neither can be mine, let me then tow to pieces, while still
< chasing thee, though tied to thee, thou damned whale! _Thus_, I give up
< the spear!‚Äù
< 
< The harpoon was darted; the stricken whale flew forward; with igniting
< velocity the line ran through the grooves;‚Äîran foul. Ahab stooped to
< clear it; he did clear it; but the flying turn caught him round the
< neck, and voicelessly as Turkish mutes bowstring their victim, he was
< shot out of the boat, ere the crew knew he was gone. Next instant, the
< heavy eye-splice in the rope‚Äôs final end flew out of the stark-empty
< tub, knocked down an oarsman, and smiting the sea, disappeared in its
< depths.
< 
< For an instant, the tranced boat‚Äôs crew stood still; then turned. ‚ÄúThe
< ship? Great God, where is the ship?‚Äù Soon they through dim, bewildering
< mediums saw her sidelong fading phantom, as in the gaseous Fata
< Morgana; only the uppermost masts out of water; while fixed by
< infatuation, or fidelity, or fate, to their once lofty perches, the
< pagan harpooneers still maintained their sinking lookouts on the sea.
< And now, concentric circles seized the lone boat itself, and all its
< crew, and each floating oar, and every lance-pole, and spinning,
< animate and inanimate, all round and round in one vortex, carried the
< smallest chip of the Pequod out of sight.
< 
< But as the last whelmings intermixingly poured themselves over the
< sunken head of the Indian at the mainmast, leaving a few inches of the
< erect spar yet visible, together with long streaming yards of the flag,
< which calmly undulated, with ironical coincidings, over the destroying
< billows they almost touched;‚Äîat that instant, a red arm and a hammer
< hovered backwardly uplifted in the open air, in the act of nailing the
< flag faster and yet faster to the subsiding spar. A sky-hawk that
< tauntingly had followed the main-truck downwards from its natural home
< among the stars, pecking at the flag, and incommoding Tashtego there;
< this bird now chanced to intercept its broad fluttering wing between
< the hammer and the wood; and simultaneously feeling that etherial
< thrill, the submerged savage beneath, in his death-gasp, kept his
< hammer frozen there; and so the bird of heaven, with archangelic
< shrieks, and his imperial beak thrust upwards, and his whole captive
< form folded in the flag of Ahab, went down with his ship, which, like
< Satan, would not sink to hell till she had dragged a living part of
< heaven along with her, and helmeted herself with it.
< 
< Now small fowls flew screaming over the yet yawning gulf; a sullen
< white surf beat against its steep sides; then all collapsed, and the
< great shroud of the sea rolled on as it rolled five thousand years ago.
< 
< 
< Epilogue
< 
< ‚ÄúAND I ONLY AM ESCAPED ALONE TO TELL THEE‚Äù Job.
< 
< The drama‚Äôs done. Why then here does any one step forth?‚ÄîBecause one
< did survive the wreck.
< 
< It so chanced, that after the Parsee‚Äôs disappearance, I was he whom the
< Fates ordained to take the place of Ahab‚Äôs bowsman, when that bowsman
< assumed the vacant post; the same, who, when on the last day the three
< men were tossed from out of the rocking boat, was dropped astern. So,
< floating on the margin of the ensuing scene, and in full sight of it,
< when the halfspent suction of the sunk ship reached me, I was then, but
< slowly, drawn towards the closing vortex. When I reached it, it had
< subsided to a creamy pool. Round and round, then, and ever contracting
< towards the button-like black bubble at the axis of that slowly
< wheeling circle, like another Ixion I did revolve. Till, gaining that
< vital centre, the black bubble upward burst; and now, liberated by
< reason of its cunning spring, and, owing to its great buoyancy, rising
< with great force, the coffin life-buoy shot lengthwise from the sea,
< fell over, and floated by my side. Buoyed up by that coffin, for almost
< one whole day and night, I floated on a soft and dirgelike main. The
< unharming sharks, they glided by as if with padlocks on their mouths;
< the savage sea-hawks sailed with sheathed beaks. On the second day, a
< sail drew near, nearer, and picked me up at last. It was the
< devious-cruising Rachel, that in her retracing search after her missing
< children, only found another orphan.

< Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm
< 
< Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
< electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
< computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
< exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
< from people in all walks of life.
< 
< Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
< assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
< goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
< remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
< Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
< and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
< generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
< Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
< Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
< www.gutenberg.org
< 
< Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary
< Archive Foundation

< The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit
< 501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
< state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
< Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
< number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
< Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
< U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.
< 
< The Foundation's business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,
< Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up
< to date contact information can be found at the Foundation's website
< and official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact
< 
< Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
< Literary Archive Foundation
< 
< Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without
< widespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
< increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
< freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
< array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
< ($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
< status with the IRS.
< 
< The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
< charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
< States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
< considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
< with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
< where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
< DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
< state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate
< 
< While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
< have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
< against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
< approach us with offers to donate.
< 
< International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
< any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
< outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
< 
< Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
< methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
< ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
< donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate
< 
< Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
< 
< Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
< Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
< freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
< distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
< volunteer support.
< 
< Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
< editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
< the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
< necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
< edition.
< 
< Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
< facility: www.gutenberg.org
< 
< This website includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
< including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
< Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
< subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
