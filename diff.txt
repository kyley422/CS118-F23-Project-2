< certain engrafted clerical peculiarities about him, imputable to that
< adventurous maritime life he had led. When he entered I observed that
< he carried no umbrella, and certainly had not come in his carriage, for
< his tarpaulin hat ran down with melting sleet, and his great pilot

< the water it had absorbed. However, hat and coat and overshoes were one
< by one removed, and hung up in a little space in an adjacent corner;
< when, arrayed in a decent suit, he quietly approached the pulpit.
< 
< Like most old fashioned pulpits, it was a very lofty one, and since a
< regular stairs to such a height would, by its long angle with the
< floor, seriously contract the already small area of the chapel, the
< architect, it seemed, had acted upon the hint of Father Mapple, and
< finished the pulpit without a stairs, substituting a perpendicular side
< ladder, like those used in mounting a ship from a boat at sea. The wife
< of a whaling captain had provided the chapel with a handsome pair of

< the matter of whales; he followed these fish for the fun of it; and a
< three years‚Äô voyage round Cape Horn was only a jolly joke that lasted
< that length of time. As a carpenter‚Äôs nails are divided into wrought
< nails and cut nails; so mankind may be similarly divided. Little Flask
< was one of the wrought ones; made to clinch tight and last long. They
< called him King-Post on board of the Pequod; because, in form, he could
< be well likened to the short, square timber known by that name in
< Arctic whalers; and which by the means of many radiating side timbers
< inserted into it, serves to brace the ship against the icy concussions
< of those battering seas.
< 
< Now these three mates‚ÄîStarbuck, Stubb, and Flask, were momentous men.
< They it was who by universal prescription commanded three of the
< Pequod‚Äôs boats as headsmen. In that grand order of battle in which
< Captain Ahab would probably marshal his forces to descend on the
< whales, these three headsmen were as captains of companies. Or, being
< armed with their long keen whaling spears, they were as a picked trio
< of lancers; even as the harpooneers were flingers of javelins.
< 
< And since in this famous fishery, each mate or headsman, like a Gothic
< Knight of old, is always accompanied by his boat-steerer or harpooneer,
< who in certain conjunctures provides him with a fresh lance, when the
< former one has been badly twisted, or elbowed in the assault; and
< moreover, as there generally subsists between the two, a close intimacy
< and friendliness; it is therefore but meet, that in this place we set
< down who the Pequod‚Äôs harpooneers were, and to what headsman each of
< them belonged.
< 
< First of all was Queequeg, whom Starbuck, the chief mate, had selected
< for his squire. But Queequeg is already known.
< 
< Next was Tashtego, an unmixed Indian from Gay Head, the most westerly
< promontory of Martha‚Äôs Vineyard, where there still exists the last
< remnant of a village of red men, which has long supplied the
< neighboring island of Nantucket with many of her most daring
---
> ignorant, unconscious fearlessness of hular about the comfortable
> arrangement of his part of the boat, as an old stage-driver is about

> off-handedly, as a whistling tinker his hammer. He would hum over his

> sort of call of the watch to tumble aloft, and bestir themselves there,
> about something which he would find out when he obeyed the order, and
> not sooner.
> 
> What, perhaps, with other things, made Stubb such an easy-going,

<

< in the water and consequent bivouacks on the deep, were matters of
< common occurrence in this kind of life; considering that at the
< superlatively critical instant of going on to the whale I must resign
< my life into the hands of him who steered the boat‚Äîoftentimes a fellow
< who at that very moment is in his impetuousness upon the point of
< scuttling the craft with his own frantic stampings; considering that
< the particular disaster to our own particular boat was chiefly to be
< imputed to Starbuck‚Äôs driving on to his whale almost in the teeth of a
< squall, and considering that Starbuck, notwithstanding, was famous for
< his great heedfulness in the fishery; considering that I belonged to
< this uncommonly prudent Starbuck‚Äôs boat; and finally considering in
< what a devil‚Äôs chase I was implicated, touching the White Whale: taking
< all things together, I say, I thought I might as well go below and make
< a rough draft of my will. ‚ÄúQueequeg,‚Äù said I, ‚Äúcome along, you shall be

< 
< It may seem strange that of all men sailors should be tinkering at

< good as the days that Lazarus lived after his resurrection; a
< supplementary clean gain of so many months or weeks as the case might
< be. I survived myself; my death and burial were locked up in my chest.

< at once started into wakefulness; and more than a score of voices from
< all parts of the vessel, simultaneously with the three notes from
< aloft, shouted forth the accustomed cry, as the great fish slowly and
< regularly spouted the sparkling brine into the air.
< 
< ‚ÄúClear away the boats! Luff!‚Äù cried Ahab. And obeying his own order, he
< dashed the helm down before the helmsman could handle the spokes.
< 
< The sudden exclamations of the crew must have alarmed the whale; and
< ere the boats were down, majestically turning, he swam away to the
< leeward, but with such a steady tranquillity, and making so few ripples
< as he swam, that thinking after all he might not as yet be alarmed,
< Ahab gave orders that not an oar should be used, and no man must speak
< but in whispers. So seated like Ontario Indians on the gunwales of the
< boats, we swiftly but silently paddled along; the calm not admitting of
< the noiseless sails being set. Presently, as we thus glided in chase,
< the monster perpendicularly flitted his tail forty feet into the air,
< and then sank out of sight like a tower swallowed up.
< 
< ‚ÄúThere go flukes!‚Äù was the cry, an announcement immediately followed by
< Stubb‚Äôs producing his match and igniting his pipe, for now a respite
< was granted. After the full interval of his sounding had elapsed, the
< whale rose again, and being now in advance of the smoker‚Äôs boat, and
< much nearer to it than to any of the others, Stubb counted upon the
< honor of the capture. It was obvious, now, that the whale had at length
< become aware of his pursuers. All silence of cautiousness was therefore
< no longer of use. Paddles were dropped, and oars came loudly into play.
< And still puffing at his pipe, Stubb cheered on his crew to the

< thee; from hell‚Äôs heart I stab at thee; for hate‚Äôs sake I spit my last
< breath at thee. Sink all coffins and all hearses to one common pool!
< and since neither can be mine, let me then tow to pieces, while still
< chasing thee, though tied to thee, thou damned whale! _Thus_, I give up
< the spear!‚Äù
< 
< The harpoon was darted; the stricken whale flew forward; with igniting
< velocity the line ran through the grooves;‚Äîran foul. Ahab stooped to
< clear it; he did clear it; but the flying turn caught him round the
< neck, and voicelessly as Turkish mutes bowstring their victim, he was
< shot out of the boat, ere the crew knew he was gone. Next instant, the
< heavy eye-splice in the rope‚Äôs final end flew out of the stark-empty
< tub, knocked down an oarsman, and smiting the sea, disappeared in its
< depths.
< 
< For an instant, the tranced boat‚Äôs crew stood still; then turned. ‚ÄúThe
< ship? Great God, where is the ship?‚Äù Soon they through dim, bewildering
< mediums saw her sidelong fading phantom, as in the gaseous Fata
< Morgana; only the uppermost masts out of water; while fixed by
< infatuation, or fidelity, or fate, to their once lofty perches, the
< pagan harpooneers still maintained their sinking lookouts on the sea.
< And now, concentric circles seized the lone boat itself, and all its
< crew, and each floating oar, and every lance-pole, and spinning,
< animate and inanimate, all round and round in one vortex, carried the
< smallest chip of the Pequod out of sight.
< 
< But as the last whelmings intermixingly poured themselves over the
< sunken head of the Indian at the mainmast, leaving a few inches of the
< erect spar yet visible, together with long streaming yards of the flag,
< which calmly undulated, with ironical coincidings, over the destroying
< billows they almost touched;‚Äîat that instant, a red arm and a hammer
< hovered backwardly uplifted in the open air, in the act of nailing the
< flag faster and yet faster to the subsiding spar. A sky-hawk that
< tauntingly had followed the main-truck downwards from its natural home
< among the stars, pecking at the flag, and incommoding Tashtego there;
< this bird now chanced to intercept its broad fluttering wing between
< the hammer and the wood; and simultaneously feeling that etherial
< thrill, the submerged savage beneath, in his death-gasp, kept his
< hammer frozen there; and so the bird of heaven, with archangelic
< shrieks, and his imperial beak thrust upwards, and his whole captive
< form folded in the flag of Ahab, went down with his ship, which, like
< Satan, would not sink to hell till she had dragged a living part of
< heaven along with her, and helmeted herself with it.
< 
< Now small fowls flew screaming over the yet yawning gulf; a sullen
< white surf beat against its steep sides; then all collapsed, and the
< great shroud of the sea rolled on as it rolled five thousand years ago.
< 
< 
< Epilogue
< 
< ‚ÄúAND I ONLY AM ESCAPED ALONE TO TELL THEE‚Äù Job.
< 
< The drama‚Äôs done. Why then here does any one step forth?‚ÄîBecause one
< did survive the wreck.
< 
< It so chanced, that after the Parsee‚Äôs disappearance, I was he whom the
< Fates ordained to take the place of Ahab‚Äôs bowsman, when that bowsman
< assumed the vacant post; the same, who, when on the last day the three
< men were tossed from out of the rocking boat, was dropped astern. So,
< floating on the margin of the ensuing scene, and in full sight of it,
< when the halfspent suction of the sunk ship reached me, I was then, but
< slowly, drawn towards the closing vortex. When I reached it, it had
< subsided to a creamy pool. Round and round, then, and ever contracting
< towards the button-like black bubble at the axis of that slowly
< wheeling circle, like another Ixion I did revolve. Till, gaining that
< vital centre, the black bubble upward burst; and now, liberated by
< reason of its cunning spring, and, owing to its great buoyancy, rising
< with great force, the coffin life-buoy shot lengthwise from the sea,
< fell over, and floated by my side. Buoyed up by that coffin, for almost
< one whole day and night, I floated on a soft and dirgelike main. The
< unharming sharks, they glided by as if with padlocks on their mouths;
< the savage sea-hawks sailed with sheathed beaks. On the second day, a
< sail drew near, nearer, and picked me up at last. It was the
< devious-cruising Rachel, that in her retracing search after her missing
< children, only found another orphan.

< provided that:
< 
< * You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from

<   does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
<   License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
<   copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
<   all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
<   works.

< are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
< from the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the manager of
< the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark. Contact the Foundation as set
< forth in Section 3 below.
< 
< 1.F.
< 
< 1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
< effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
< works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
< Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
< electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
< contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
< or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
< intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
< other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
< cannot be read by your equipment.
< 
< 1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
< of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
< Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
< Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
< Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
< liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
< fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
< LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
< PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
< TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
< LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
< INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
< DAMAGE.
< 
< 1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
< defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
< receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
< written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
< received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
< with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
< with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
< lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
< or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
< opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
< the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
< without further opportunities to fix the problem.
< 
< 1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
< in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO

< 
< 1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
< warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
< damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
< violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
< agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
< limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
< unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
< remaining provisions.
< 
< 1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
< trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
< providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
< accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
< production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
< electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
< including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
< the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
< or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
< additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
< Defect you cause.
< 
< Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm
< 
< Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
< electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
< computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
< exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
< from people in all walks of life.
< 
< Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
< assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
< goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
< remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
< Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
< and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
< generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
< Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
< Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
< www.gutenberg.org
< 
< Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary
< Archive Foundation
< 
< The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit
< 501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
< state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
< Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
< number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
< Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
< U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.
< 
< The Foundation's business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,
< Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up
< to date contact information can be found at the Foundation's website
< and official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact
< 
< Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
< Literary Archive Foundation
< 
< Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without
< widespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
< increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
< freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
< array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
< ($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
< status with the IRS.
< 
< The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
< charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
< States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
< considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
< with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
< where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
< DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
< state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate
< 
< While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
< have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
< against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
< approach us with offers to donate.
< 
< International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
< any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
< outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
< 
< Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
< methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
< ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
< donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate
< 
< Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
< 
< Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
< Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
< freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
< distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
< volunteer support.
< 
< Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
< editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
< the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
< necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
< edition.
< 
< Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
< facility: www.gutenberg.org
< 
< This website includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
< including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
< Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
< subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
